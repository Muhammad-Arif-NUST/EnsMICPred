# EnsMICPred
The proposed EnsMICPred method use the voting-based ensemble model and incorporate the graphical-, compositional- and physicochemical-based properties of the peptide sequence. These descriptors are Gapped dipeptide composition (GapDPC), composition-transition and distribution (CTD) and graphical and statistical feature (GSFE).
